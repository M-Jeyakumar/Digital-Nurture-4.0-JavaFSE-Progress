## Exercise 2 - Ecommerce Platform Search Function

Big O Notation:
  It is referred to the worst case time complexity of an algorithm. It helps us to understand the performance of an algorithm for the input size n.
  
Linear Search:
1. Best case - O(1)
2. Average case - O(n)
3. Worst case - O(n)

Binary Search:
1. Best case - O(1)
2. Average case - O(log n)
3. Worst case - O(log n)

Output:

Final Analysis:
* In my opinion Binary Search is the best and more suitable for the E-Commerce platform.
* Because it will process so quickly and find the required products in minimal amount of time.
* So it will reduce the time for the user to wait for the product search operation.
* And it's time complexity is also O(log N)
